# Bootstrapping
Bootstrapping is any test or metric that uses random sampling with replacement, and falls under the broader class of resampling methods(wiki)

Air Secure wishes to open a number of new service desks, guaranteeing that in the long run 90% of their customers do not have to wait longer than 8 minutes in a waiting queue before they are served. Preliminary research by Air Secure showed that on arrival customers always choose the smallest queue and remain there until served. This research also investigated the passengers inter-arrival time (in minutes) and the service time. The results are summarized in data.csv. The data for the first four passengers is provided

We need to perform a Discrete-Event Simulation study in Matlab, Python, or R, to answer the following question: How many service desks should be minimally available to meet the service requirements? Namely, how many service desks should be available such that with probability 0.9, a customer do not have to wait longer than 8 minutes in a waiting queue before they are served. Run the simulation for T = 3000 units of time.
 
Perform a Discrete-Event Simulation study to answer the following question. (a) Give the problem summary and describe the project objective. (b) Give a specification of variables used in the simulation study. In addition, show a diagram that describes the project dynamics. (c) Results and Analysis. Using tables and figures, present a clear outcome of your study. Present the corresponding confidence intervals. (d) Formulate your conclusions. (e) Appendix. Include all code files used. Explain their interaction and provide a clear and well-commented code.
